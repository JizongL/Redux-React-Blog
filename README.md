## Introduction 
This is a exercise project demonstrating the basic use of React and Redux. It uses Redux to manage the states 
of the components, in this case, the user names and the posts fetched from the api. It also uses [lodash](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#memoize) memoize technique and combined action creators to optimize over fetching.
